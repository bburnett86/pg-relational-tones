Functional JavaScript

  Objects
    A data structure where we store data
    We can store properties: functions, strings, numbers, objects, arrays, etc.
    Key value pairs, key is a string
    Blueprint of a class
    The data we store can be any type.

    Data:

      var box = {};

    Assignment with Dots

      var box = {};
      box.material = "cardboard";

      Thus

      var box =
      {"material" : "cardboard"}

      Above code assigns the key "material" to the value "cardboard"

      Whenever you use dot, whatever's to the left of the dot is an object. Whether it's an array, function whatever it's ALWAYS an object.

    Access with Dots

      var box = {};

      box.material = "cardboard"

      var cb = box.material;

      cb; //"cardboard"

      box.material = "titanium";

      cb;// "cardboard"

      box.size; //undefined
      We get undefined when we look up the property of an object that does not exist.

    Brackets

      var box = {};
      box["material"] = "cardboard";
      box.material; // "cardboard"
      var cb = box["material"]; // "cardboard"

    Variables

      var box = {};

      box["material"] = "cardboard";

      var key = "material"

      box[key]; //"cardboard"

  Arrays
